Law of Inheritance





PART-A
GENERAL PRINCIPLES & RULES



Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	3
 
1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW OF INHERITANCE


	What is inheritance?: What the relatives of a deceased person get without the consent or option of the deceased (propositus) in the estate, i.e. the property or actionable claim left behind by him, is known in legal terminology as “inheritance”.








DR. M & N	4
 




	Conditions for Inheritance: There are three conditions to inherit from estate of a deceased person:
i.	Certainty or a strong belief about the death of propositus;

ii.	Certainty or a strong belief about the life of the claimant-heirs at the time of the death of the propositus; and
iii.	Knowledge about the dimensions of inheritance, i.e. knowledge as to who is an heir and on what grounds.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	5
 



	The Islamic scheme of inheritance discloses three peculiarities:

i)	The Quran gives specific shares to certain individuals;
ii)	The Residue goes to Agnatic Heirs and failing them to the
Uterine Heirs;
iii)	Bequests are limited to 1/3 of the estate.

	Note: No Muhammadan is allowed to make a Will in favour of any of his heirs, and a bequest to a stranger is allowed only to the extent 1/3 of the property.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	6
 

2. GENERAL RULES OF LAW OF INHERITANCE

RULES OF TOTAL AND PARTIAL EXCLUSION

	Both under Sunni and Shia systems, every person is entitled to inherit, unless there is something to exclude him. A child in the womb is regarded as a living person provided he is born alive.
	Both the Shia and Sunni systems recognised two types of exclusions:
	Partial or Imperfect exclusion; and
	Total or perfect exclusion




Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	9
 



Law of Inheritance


PARTIAL OR IMPERFECT EXCLUSION
(It may come in TWO ways)

	Exclusion from one share and admission to another.
	For example, daughter in the presence of son is excluded as a ‘Sharer’ and
becomes ‘Residuary’.
	Partial reduction of the specific share because of the presence of certain heirs.
	For example, the share of wife is either 1/4th or 1/8th according to the absence or presence of a child or child of a son, how low so ever. Similar is the case of husband, whose share is either ½ or 1/4th.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	10
 
Law of Inheritance
TOTAL OR PERFECT EXCLUSION
	The term ‘total exclusion’ applies to cases when although a person, related to the propositus and otherwise entitled to inherit, is excluded by some ‘legal cause’.
	Both in Shia and Sunni systems this type of exclusion is based on three
principles:




Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	11
 



Law of Inheritance




	Principle-I: “Nearer in degree excludes more remote.”


Grand Father
Father


	Ex: Father (100%)  excludes grandfather (0%).



Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	12
 



Law of Inheritance



	Principle-II:	“ A person who is related to the deceased through another is exclude by the presence of latter.”
Father	Brother

	Ex: Father (gets 100%) excludes brother (0%).

	Exception: Mother does not exclude brother or sister.

Brother	Mother	Sister
5/9	1/6	5/18	=	10+3+5  = 18
18	18
= 1
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	13
 



Law of Inheritance


	Principle-III: “Full blood excludes half blood”.
Full Blood	Half-Blood

Father----------------Mother	Mother-----Father	Mother

Son	Daughter	Son	Daughter
	Exception: Uterine relations (ie. Same mother but different fathers) are not excluded on this ground.
Mother----Father	Father

Law of Inheritance



MOST IMPORTANT OF TOTAL EXCLUSIONS UNDER MUSLIM LAW ARE ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:

	Religion
	Homicide
	Illegitimacy
	Relinquishment of Inheritance Rights




Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	15
 

HANAFI (SUNNI) LAW OF INHERITANCE


	Hanafi jurists divide heirs into seven classes,	the three principal and the four subsidiary classes:
	Principal Classes:
i.	Quranic Heirs (Sharers);
ii.	Agnatic Heirs (Residuaries);
iii.	Uterine Heirs (Distant Kindred)




Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	16
 



Law of Inheritance



	Subsidiary Classes:

iv.	The successor by Contract;
v.	The Acknowledged kinsman;
vi.	The Sole Legatee;
vii.	The State, by Escheat





Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	17
 



Law of Inheritance

NOTE: (PRINCIPAL CLASSES)
	The first step in the distribution of the estate of a deceased Muslim, after payment of his funeral expenses, debts and legacies, is to allot their respective shares to the Quranic Heirs.
	If any residue is left, it is to be divided among Agnatic heirs (Residuaries).
	If there be neither Sharers nor Residuaries, the estate will be distributed among Distant Kindred. The distant kindred are not entitled to succeed so long as there is any heir belonging to the class of Sharers or Residuaries. But there is one case in which the Distant Kindred will inherit with a Sharer, and that is when the Sharer is the wife (widow) or husband of the deceased.

Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	18
 



Law of Inheritance

NOTE: (SUBSIDIARY CLASSES)

	In the absence of a member of the three principal classes (ie. Quranic, Agnatic and Uterine heirs) the right of inheritance devolves upon subsidiary heirs, among whom each class excludes the next.
	Subsidiary Classes:
i.	The successor by Contract;
ii.	The Acknowledged kinsman;
iii.	The Sole Legatee;
iv.	The State, by Escheat
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	19
 
Law of Inheritance
(i)	Quranic Heirs (Sharers)
	Sharers are those heirs who are entitled to get a prescribed share from the heritable property. The Sharers and their respective shares in the property of a deceased are given in Quran. The Sharers are, therefore, also called as Quranic heirs.
	In the distribution of property, the Sharers get preference over the other class of heirs, therefore, first of all the respective share is allotted to each Sharer. It may be noted that Sharers are those heirs whose respective shares are given in Quran; therefore, their shares cannot be altered by any human effort.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	20
 



Law of Inheritance

(ii)	Residuaries or Agnatic Heirs
(Note: Agnatic Heirs means a person related to wholly through males either by blood or by adoption (No adoption under Muslim Law).
	Residuaries are those heirs who inherit only the residue of the property after allotment of respective shares to the Sharers. Obviously, the Residuaries have no specific share of their own. After giving the property to the Sharers in their fixed shares, if there remains some property that ‘remaining property’ (residue) is available to the Residuaries.

	The residue may differ from case to case. If there are no Sharers, the whole is inherited by the Residuaries. Residuary heirs are also termed as Agnatic heirs because they inherit through male relations.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	21
 



Law of Inheritance



(iii)	Distant Kindred or Uterine Heirs
	All those persons who are related to propositus through blood but could not be included as heirs in the class of Sharers or of Residuaries, are called distant kindred. If a propositus has neither Sharers nor Residuaries, the properties are inherited by his Distant Kindred. Distant Kindreds cannot inherit in presence of any Sharer or Residuary. The heirs included in this class are also termed as uterine heirs.
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	22

PRACTICAL SESSIONS



Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	31
 


	Property is = 1
 
Problem-1
Father; True Grandfather
 

	Go To: Table of Shares – Sunni Law
	Select Father and check the share: Father gets 1/6 Share
	Balance: 1-1/6 = 5/6
	Check: True Grandfather under Column-4: “provided there is no father”
	Because “Father” is there “True Grandfather” will not get anything.
	Hence Father gets: His actual share 1/6 + Under Residuary (II. Ascendants;
3. Father)
	Finally Father gets: 1/6 + 5/6 = 6/6 = 1
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	32

	Property = 1
 
Problem-2 Father; Mother
 

	Go To: Table of Shares – Sunni Law
	Select “Father” and check the share: Father gets 1/6
	Select “Mother” and check the share: Mother gets = 1/3
	Hence, Father gets = 1/6 share; and Mother gets = 1/3 share
	Total Shares of Father + Mother = 1/6 + 1/3 = 3 + 6 = 9	= 1
18	18	2
	1 – ½ = Residue is ½;

	Hence, Father gets (1/6 + 1/2 =2/3) and Mother gets 1/3= 2 +1 = 3 = 1
3	3
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	34
 
Problem-3
Father; Mother; Son; Daughter

	Father = 1/6
	Mother= 1/6
	Son = Not shown in Sharers, but shown in Residuary (Under Descendants)
	Daughter = Go to Sharers (Sl. No. 7) and Column 4
	Go to Residuary (1. Descendants 1. Son; Daughter takes as a Residuary)
	Property = 1
	Father: Mother = 1/6 : 1/6 = 2/6 =1/3
	Balance 1 – 1/3 = 2/3
	Balance of 2/3 to be shared between Son: Daughter ie. 2:1 = 2/3 and 1/3
	Balance of 2/3 shared by Son in the ratio of 2/3 = 2/3 X 2/3 = 4/9
	Balance of 2/3 shared by Daughter in the ratio of 1/3 = 2/3 X 1/3 = 2/9
	Father: Mother: Son: Daughter = 1/6 : 1/6: 4/9:2/9
	Add Total shares: 1 : 1: 4 : 2	= 3 + 3 + 8 + 4	=	18	=
1
	6	6 9	9	18	18		
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	35
 
Problem-4 Wife and Son

	Wife: Go To Sharers Sl. No. 4 – she gets = 1/8
	Son:	He is not in Sharer’s List, hence go to Residuaries (I. Descendants:
1. Son)
	Property = 1
	Wife = 1/8
	Balance: 1 – 1/8 = 7/8
	Hence, Son as a Residuary gets the residue ie. 7/8
	Finally, Wife (1/8) and Son (7/8) = 1 + 7	= 8	= 1
8	8	8
Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	36
 
Problem-5 Daughter; Full Sister

	Property = 1
	Daughter: Go To Sharers Sl. No.7 = 1/2
	Full Sister: Go To Sharers Sl. No. 11 = 1/2
	Hence: Daughter + Full Sister = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1






Dr. Shaik Nazim Ahmed Shafi, Assistant Professor of Law NALSAR University of Law	37
 
Problem-6 Mother, Father, Son

	Total Property = 1
	Mother = 1/6 (M) i.e. 1 – 1/6 = 5/6 ……..(Balance of Property left after
giving to Mother)
	Father =	Balance 5/6	- 1/6 (F) =	4/6….(Balance of Property left after
giving to Father
	Son: Balance is 4/6 i.e., 2/3
	Add: Father+Mother+Son’s Property: 1/6+1/6+2/3 = 1 + 1 + 4 =	6 =	1
6	6
	Hence, Total Property is: 1
	ANSWER: Mother: 1/6; Father: 1/6; Son: 2/3

Doctrine of Aul (Increase)

	If it is found on assigning their respective shares to the Sharers that the total of the shares exceeds unity the share of each Sharer is proportionately diminished by reducing the fractional share to a common denominator, and increasing the denominator so as to make it equal to the sum of the numerators.
	Example: Refer Next Slide











DR. M & N	40
 


	Example: (i) Husband and (ii) Two Full Sisters
	As per the Rule of Husband:	He gets: 1/2 share
	As per the Rule of Full Sister’s:	They get: 2/3 share

	H + FS = 1/2 + 2/3 =	3 + 4 =	7
6	6
	Note: The sum total of 1/2 and 2/3 exceeds unity. The fractions are therefore reduced to a common denominator, which, in this case, is 6. The sum of numerators is 7, and the process consists in substituting 7 for 6 as the denominator of the fractions 3/6 and 4/6. By doing so the total of the shares equals unity. The doctrine of ‘Increase’ is so called because it is by increasing the denominator from 6 to 7 that the sum of the shares is made equal to unity.
DR. M & N	41
 



	Example: A Mahomedan dies leaving a widow as his sole heir. The widow will take 1/4 as Sharer, and the remaining 3/4 by Return. The surplus 3/4 does not escheat to the Government



















DR. M & N	42
 

Doctrine of Radd (Return)

	If there is a residue left after satisfying the claims of Sharers, but there is no Residuary, the residue reverts to the Sharers in proportion to their shares. This right of reverter is technically called “Return” or “Radd”.
	Exception: Neither the husband nor the wife is entitle to the Return so long as there is any other heir, whether he be a Sharer of a Distant Kinsman. But if there be no other heir, the residue will go the hubsand or the wife, as the case may be.

copy of Table of Sharers and Residuaries.
	While giving your answer relating to Muslim Law of Inheritance, you should give CALCULATIONS and also a TABLE (Refer: Slides Nos. 23 & 24).
	You start from ONE PROPERTY and finally if you add all shares you should get ONE PROPERTY i.e. 2 X 2 = 4 but not less than four nor more than four.
	No assumptions/presumptions while calculating shares.
	Just giving direct answers will not fetch MARKS.



DR. M & N	45
 
IN END-SEMESTER
